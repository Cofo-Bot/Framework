- Cofo is a framework made in [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) built on top of [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris)

- Time back, I used to use [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) as a library to create discord bots as it was really easy but my bots wouldnt always be ready for production use and it would take a lot of memory due to higher caching, So, My friend told me about [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) and i planned to switch over to eris, I found eris to be really interesting as it took less disk space and less memory as compared to Discordjs, But it had an issue, It had compartively less methods, So to make everybody's work easier i made this framework
